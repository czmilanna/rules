Mammographic Mass data set

1: Description.

This data set can be used to predict the severity (benign or malignant) of a mammographic mass lesion from BI-RADS attributes and the patient's age.
It contains a BI-RADS assessment, the patient's age and three BI-RADS attributes together with the ground truth (the severity field, which is the target attribute).

The data was collected at the Institute of Radiology of the University Erlangen-Nuremberg between 2003 and 2006.
